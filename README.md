Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. Its importance to technology industry is it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life including communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.  

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Development of the First High-Level Programming Language in 1957 like Fortran (Formula Translation) etc. 
Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in 1960 like Waterfall mode in 1970
The rise of Agile methodologies in the 2000's such as Scrum and Kanban. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements - This includes gathering and documenting users needs and system  requiremnts.
Design - Creating detail design of the software (solution)
Implimentation - Writing of the actual code to come up with the solution. 
Testing - Checking the proper functionality of the solution (software). 
Deployment - Releasing the software to the user. 
Maintenance - providing continous updates and support to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall - It is rigid and follows certian sequence applicable in situations where project requirements are well-defined and unlikely to change.
Agile  - It follows Iterative and incremental approach applicable in situations where project requirements are flexible, collaborative and can respond to change. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer - Responsible for developing the software (code writing)
Quality Assurance Engineer - Responsible for quality software designs and executing test plans.
Project Manager - Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Importance of IDEs - provide a platform for writing, debugging and testing codes. Examples VS Code, Sublime text, NetBeans and PyCharm. 
Importance of VCS - they provide tool for tracking changes to files and enabling users to collaborate on projects. Examples Git, Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requiremnts, Tight deadlines, Technical Debts. Strategies to overcome challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing -  tests individual units of code, such as functions or classes.
Integration testing - tests how different units of code work together.
System testing - tests the entire software system as a whole. 
Acceptance testing - tests the software system from the user's perspective.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining the prompts that are used in machine learning models, particularly language models. It involves creating clear, concise, and specific prompts that guide the model's behavior and achieve the desired outcomes.
Importance - Enhanced Model Performance, Reduced Training Data Dependency, Controllable Generation, Accelerated Model Development and Improved Interpretability.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of Vague prompt : Write a blog post about something interesting.
Improved prompt : Write a blog post that explores the emerging trends in artificial intelligence and their potential impact on the healthcare industry. Ensure to provide specific examples and statistics to support your claims. 
     Why the improved prompt is more effective. 
Clarity: It clearly defines the topic and the desired outcome.
Specificity: It provides specific instructions on the content, including the focus on artificial intelligence in healthcare.
Conciseness: It avoids unnecessary details and focuses on the essential aspects of the writing task.
Measurability: The prompt provides criteria for evaluation (specific examples and statistics) to assess the writer's adherence to the instructions.
